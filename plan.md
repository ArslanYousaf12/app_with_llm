# Voice-Activated Timer App Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a Flutter voice-activated timer app for hands-free use during calisthenics exercises with dark mode theming and SS.S time format.

## Phase 1: Foundation & UI (Primary Focus)

### âœ… Step 1: Project Setup & Dependencies
- [x] Add required packages: `speech_to_text`, `permission_handler`, `audioplayers`
- [x] Configure iOS/Android permissions in manifest files for microphone access
- [x] Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies

### âœ… Step 2: Dark Theme Implementation
- [x] Replace default MaterialApp theme with dark ColorScheme
- [x] Define consistent dark theme colors following Material Design
- [x] Update app title to "Voice Timer"

### âœ… Step 3: Architecture, Font Setup & Basic Timer Page
- [x] Create organized folder structure: `lib/screens/`, `lib/widgets/`, `lib/services/`
- [x] Setup BabasNeue font configuration in pubspec.yaml
- [x] Create basic TimerPage with placeholder UI for early testing
- [x] Update main.dart to use TimerPage as home screen
- [x] Remove boilerplate counter app code

### âœ… Step 4: Timer Display UI Component with Ticker (SS.S Format)
- [x] Create TimerDisplay widget using Ticker for smooth refresh rate
- [x] Implement SS.S format (e.g., "72.3" for 1:12.3)
- [x] Use BabasNeue font for timer display
- [x] Style with large, readable text using theme colors
- [x] Handle time formatting logic (minutes to total seconds conversion)

### âœ… Step 5: Control Buttons UI & Updated Timer Page Testing
- [x] Create ControlButtons widget with Start/Stop/Reset buttons
- [x] Style buttons similar to iOS stopwatch app
- [x] Use proper spacing and flex layout for responsive design
- [x] Update TimerPage to include new ControlButtons widget
- [x] Test UI layout and button interactions

### âœ… Step 6: Stopwatch Logic Implementation (Simplified)
- [x] Declare Stopwatch directly in TimerScreen state
- [x] Pass Stopwatch as argument to TimerDisplay widget
- [x] Implement start, stop, and reset operations
- [x] Connect button actions to Stopwatch methods
- [x] Ensure proper state management and UI updates

## Phase 2: Voice Integration

### âœ… Step 7: Permission Handling
- [x] Request microphone permissions on app startup
- [x] Handle permission denied states gracefully
- [x] Disable voice features when permissions not granted
- [x] Show appropriate UI feedback for permission status

### âœ… Step 8: Speech Recognition Setup
- [x] Initialize speech_to_text service
- [x] Implement continuous listening for voice commands
- [x] Handle speech recognition lifecycle (start/stop listening)
- [x] Add error handling for speech service failures

### âœ… Step 9: Voice Command Parsing
- [x] Add voice command parsing for "start" and "stop" commands
- [x] Implement command validation and filtering
- [x] Handle different pronunciations and variations
- [x] Add logging for voice recognition events

### âœ… Step 10: Audio Feedback Implementation
- [x] Implement beep sound playback on command recognition
- [x] Handle audio permissions and playback errors
- [x] Add audio assets for beep sounds
- [x] Test audio feedback on different devices

### âœ… Step 11: Voice-Timer Integration
- [x] Connect voice commands to existing timer actions
- [x] Ensure voice commands work seamlessly with UI controls
- [x] Handle conflicts between voice and manual controls
- [x] Test complete voice-activated workflow

## Phase 3: Testing & Polish

### âœ… Step 12: Widget Testing
- [x] Widget tests for TimerDisplay component
- [x] Widget tests for ControlButtons component
- [x] Integration tests for timer functionality
- [x] Test timer accuracy and performance

### âœ… Step 13: Final Polish & Responsive Design
- [x] Test responsive design across different screen sizes
- [x] UI accessibility improvements
- [x] Error handling and edge case management
- [x] Performance optimization and cleanup

## Technical Requirements

### Time Format
- Display format: SS.S (e.g., "72.3" for 1 minute 12.3 seconds)
- Convert minutes:seconds to total seconds for display
- Use decimal precision for sub-second timing

### UI Components
- **TimerDisplay**: Uses Ticker for smooth refresh at screen refresh rate
- **ControlButtons**: Start/Stop/Reset styled like iOS stopwatch
- **TimerPage**: Main screen container with proper layout

### Architecture
- Stopwatch declared directly in TimerScreen state (no ChangeNotifier needed)
- TimerDisplay receives Stopwatch as parameter
- Clean separation between UI and business logic

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing possible at each major step
- Each phase builds incrementally for continuous validation
- UI testing prioritized for immediate feedback

## Current Status
- âœ… All 13 steps completed successfully
- ðŸŽ‰ Project implementation complete
- ðŸ“± Voice-activated timer app ready for use

## Notes
- Focus on UI-first approach for immediate testability
- Voice features added after core timer functionality is solid
- Dark mode only as specified in requirements
- BabasNeue font integrated for professional timer display
